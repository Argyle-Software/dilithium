A rust implementation of the Dilithium, a KEM standardised by the NIST Post-Quantum Standardization Project.

See the [**features**](#features) section for different options regarding security levels and modes of operation. The default security setting is Dilithium3.

It is recommended to use Dilithium in a hybrid system alongside a traditional signature algorithm such as ed25519. 

**Minimum Supported Rust Version: 1.50.0**

## Installation

```shell
cargo add pqc_dilithium
``` 

## Usage 

```rust
use pqc_dilithium::*;
```

### Key Generation
```rust
let keys = Keypair::generate();
assert!(keys.public.len() == PUBLICKEYBYTES);
assert!(keys.expose_secret().len() == SECRETKEYBYTES);
```

### Signing 
```rust
let msg = "Hello".as_bytes();
let sig = keys.sign(&msg);
assert!(sig.len() == SIGNBYTES);
```

### Verification
```rust
let sig_verify = verify(&sig, &msg, &keys.public);
assert!(sig_verify.is_ok());
```

## AES mode

Dilithium-AES, that uses AES-256 in counter mode instead of SHAKE to 
expand the matrix and the masking vectors, and to sample the secret polynomials.
This offers hardware speedups on certain platforms.

## Randomized signing

One may want to consider randomized signatures in situations where the side channel
attacks of [SBB+18, PSS+18] exploiting determinism are applicable. Another situation
where one may want to avoid determinism is when the signer does not wish to reveal the
message that is being signed. While there is no timing leakage of the secret key, there is
timing leakage of the message if the scheme is deterministic. Since the randomness of the
scheme is derived from the message, the number of aborts for a particular message will
always be the same.

## Testing 

To run the known answer tests, you'll need to enable the `dilithium_kat` config flag eg.

```shell
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg dilithium_kat" cargo test
```

To run through all possible features use the [`test_matrix.sh`](./tests/test_matrix.sh) script.

## Alternatives

The PQClean project has rust bindings for their C post quantum libraries.

## About

Dilithium is a digital signature scheme that is strongly secure under chosen message attacks based on the hardness of lattice problems over module lattices. The security notion means that an adversary having access to a signing oracle cannot produce a signature of a message whose signature he hasn't yet seen, nor produce a different signature of a message that he already saw signed. Dilithium has been standardised by the [NIST post-quantum cryptography project](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/selected-algorithms-2022).
